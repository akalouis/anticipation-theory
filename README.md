**Theory of Anticipation (ToA)** is a new mathematical framework for quantifying engagement, or "fun." Created primarily as a game design tool, it offers an objective and computable measure of a player's engagement.

This repository contains the official C++17 implementation of the theory. For a more intuitive, non-technical explanation, please refer to the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@aka.louis/can-you-mathematically-measure-fun-you-could-not-until-now-01168128d428). The formal academic details are available in the [foundational paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15826917).

## Overview

The Theory of Anticipation provides a formal language to describe and optimize for "fun." It aims to move aspects of game design from pure intuition to a domain that can be analytically explored and computationally optimized. By modeling a game as a system of states and probabilities, it calculates the engagement a player feels moment-to-moment.

### Inputs

1.  **Game Model**: The game is represented as a probabilistic graph:

      * **States ($s$)**: All possible, discrete game situations.
      * **Transitions ($P(s \\to s')$**: The probability of moving from one state to another.

2.  **Intrinsic Desire ($D\_{local}$)**: The root "seed" desire from which all derived anticipation values are generated. To enable objective analysis, you simply define the ultimate goal (e.g., set the "win condition" state to `1` and all other states to `0`). All other desire and anticipation values for the entire game are then computed automatically from this input.

### Outputs

  * **Global Desire ($D\_{global}$)**: The computed desirability of a given state.
  * **Anticipation ($A\_1$)**: The immediate, quantifiable "fun" of any given state.
  * **Nested Anticipation ($A\_2, A\_3, ...$)**: Higher-order components of anticipation for any given state, capturing deeper strategic fun.
  * **Game Design Score**: A single, objective score for the entire game design.

### Core Foundation

At its heart, the theory measures the uncertainty of meaningfulness of future branches. The Local Anticipation ($A\_1$) for a given state ($s$) is calculated as:

$$A_1(s) = \sqrt{\sum_{s'} P(s \to s') \cdot (D(s') - \mu)^2}$$

This formula is the core of the theory, from which all other metrics are derived through algorithmic expansion. Detailed implementation specifics, such as the concept of "Perspective Desire" or efficient dynamic programming practices, are fully documented within the source code.

## Empirical Proof: Playable Demos ðŸŽ®

Below are two browser-playable versions of a simple game. The second version has been optimized by a computer algorithm, guided only by ToA's formulas, to maximize its "Game Design Score."

  * **Play the Baseline Game: [HpGame](https://akalouis.github.io/anticipation-theory/Html/hpgame.html)**
  * **Play the Optimized Game: [HpGame\_Rage\_Optimized](https://akalouis.github.io/anticipation-theory/Html/hpgame_rage_optimized.html)**

You will likely find the second game more engaging. This is a powerful and intuitive empirical proof that the Theory of Anticipation works.

## Included Experiments

The following experiments are implemented as demonstrations and test cases for the theory.

  * `rock_paper_scissors`
  * `cointoss`
  * `hpgame` (The baseline playable demo)
  * `hpgame_interactive`
  * `hpgame_rage`
  * `hpgame_rage_optimize_critchance`
  * `hpgame_rage_compare_mechanics`
  * `hpgame_rage_optimized` (The optimized playable demo)

**Note**: Please refer to the source code for the most current and complete list of experiments.

## Examples

The framework allows you to define a complete game model with minimal code. The engine will then compute the anticipation and evaluate your design. Below is the full example required to implement and analyze a new experiment.

```cpp
module;
export module hpgame_v1;
import "pch.h";
import game;

export namespace hpgame
{
	struct State
	{
		unsigned char hp1; // player1 hp
		unsigned char hp2; // player2 hp
		auto operator <=> (const State&) const = default;
	};
	struct Transition { float probability; State to; };

	struct Game
	{
		typedef game::EmptyConfig Config;
		typedef State State;

		static State initial_state() { return State{ 5, 5 }; }
		static bool is_terminal_state(const State& s) { return s.hp1 <= 0 || s.hp2 <= 0; }
		static std::vector<Transition> get_transitions(Config, const State& state)
		{
			std::vector<Transition> result;
			if (is_terminal_state(state)) return result;

			// win, draw, loss version
			result.push_back({ 1.0f / 3.0f, State{ state.hp1, (unsigned char)(state.hp2 - 1) }, });
			result.push_back({ 1.0f / 3.0f, State{ (unsigned char)(state.hp1 - 1), (unsigned char)(state.hp2 - 1) }, });
			result.push_back({ 1.0f / 3.0f, State{ (unsigned char)(state.hp1 - 1), state.hp2 }, });

			game::sanitize_transitions(result);
			return result;
		}
		static float compute_intrinsic_desire(const State& state)
		{
			// Player 1 wins if their HP is > 0 and Player 2's HP is 0
			return state.hp1 != 0 && state.hp2 == 0 ? 1.0f : 0.0f;
		}
		static std::string tostr(const State& s) { return "HP1:" + std::to_string(s.hp1) + " HP2:" + std::to_string(s.hp2); }
	};
}
```
